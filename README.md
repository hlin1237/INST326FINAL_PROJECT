# INST326FINAL_PROJECT
Project Team: Huimin Lin, Muneeb Sahibzada, Justine Uyan, Kelly Le,


This project of ours is a tic-tac-toe game. Our program gives a user interface to play the game. 
To run the game, the python file name can be run in the command line terminal.
No other inputs on the command line are needed in order to play the game. Once the program is open, the board is set up with all nine square open. 
There is also an optional instructions tab that gives extra information for the user. The first move will be the user and then the computer will follow along. 
The outputs of the program are simply if the user wins, or the computer ai wins, or if it is a tie. 
After an end state of the board is reached the board can be reset with the restart button.

        As we used tkinter to base our game's interface we referenced the official tkinter module documentation alot to check for codes to use.

        This youtube video source was used as part of our interface to just give external information on tic tac toe. 
        It is an option the user can go to in the instructions popup.
