# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Project Team:

## Project Overview:
This project is a classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game developed using Python. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for an interactive gameplay experience. The user competes against the computer AI, alternating turns to mark squares on the game board until a winner is determined or the game ends in a tie.

## How to Run:
To start the game, simply run the `tic_tac_toe.py` Python file in a command line terminal:
```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py

## Features:
- **User Interface**: The game features a 3x3 grid where both the player and the computer take turns marking their moves.
- **Instructions Tab**: An optional tab is available that provides gameplay instructions and tips for new players.
- **Reset Option**: Once the game concludes (whether it's a win, loss, or tie), players can restart the game using the restart button without needing to re-run the program.

## Gameplay:
- **The user makes the first move**, followed by the computer AI.
- **The game outputs the result at the end**: win, loss, or tie.
